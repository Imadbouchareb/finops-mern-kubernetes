# mern-blog

This project is built using the MERN stack as well as TailwindCSS and DaisyUI and is the first project that I've done without a step-by-step video tutorial.

The blog at the time of this README creation includes CRUD functionality for Posts, lists of posts on a homepage, as well as individual post pages; in summary
it has basic functionality but still needs lots of polish.

PLANNED CHANGES:

-Create footer and static pages (about, contact, etc) with respective forms that connect to MongoDB.
-Create a mock logo and add it to project, improve the UI for mobile and incorporate best practices (vague because I'm not quite sure what they are yet)
-Add post category and post author models and to individual posts
-Add user and superuser feature with backend admin page for all CRUD stuff.
-Add login + registration feature

I'm not sure how long this will take to implement, but hopefully no longer than a couple months if I stay consistent.
