# mern-blog

UPDATE: All the features that I set out to implement in this project are DONE! Will continue to add final touches over the next week or two but I am very happy with how it all turned out - because at times I wanted to rip my hair out working on this thing!

This project is built using the MERN stack as well as TailwindCSS and DaisyUI and is the first project that I've done without a step-by-step video tutorial.

The blog at the time of this README creation includes CRUD functionality for Posts, lists of posts on a homepage, as well as individual post pages; in summary it has basic functionality but still needs lots of polish.

Initially PLANNED FEATURES:

-Create footer and static pages (about, contact, etc) with respective forms that connect to MongoDB.
-Create a mock logo and add it to project, improve the UI for mobile and incorporate best practices (vague because I'm not quite sure what they are yet)
-Add user and superuser feature with backend admin page for all CRUD stuff.
-Add login + registration feature

I'm not sure how long this will take to implement, but hopefully no longer than a couple months if I stay consistent.
